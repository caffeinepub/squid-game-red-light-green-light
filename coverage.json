        "summary": "In movementDetection.ts, strengthen the dead zone check so that any movement score strictly below (threshold × 0.10) is clamped to zero before being returned. The raw smoothed score must be evaluated against the dead zone boundary first, and if it falls within the dead zone, the exported movement score must be 0 — not the raw value. This ensures downstream game logic in useGameState.ts and gameState.ts never receives a non-zero score for sub-dead-zone motion.",

        "summary": "In gameState.ts, add an explicit guard in the elimination-check logic: before transitioning to 'eliminated', assert that the movement score is strictly greater than (threshold × 0.10). If the score is at or below that boundary, the elimination transition must be blocked unconditionally, acting as a second line of defence independent of the clamping in movementDetection.ts.",

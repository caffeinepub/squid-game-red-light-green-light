        "summary": "In movementDetection.ts, make the exponential smoothing asymmetric: when the current per-landmark delta (after base-threshold pre-filter) is zero or below the base threshold — meaning the player has stopped moving — reset the smoothed score to zero immediately rather than decaying it gradually. Only apply the slow decay formula (smoothedDelta = prevDelta × 0.8 + currentDelta × 0.2) when active movement is detected. This ensures the exported movement score drops to zero the moment no movement is registered, eliminating the perceived lag when the player freezes.",

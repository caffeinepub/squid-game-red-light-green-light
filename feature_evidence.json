      "featureTitle": "In movementDetection.ts, strengthen the dead zone check so that any movement score strictly below (threshold × 0.10) is clamped to zero before being returned. The raw smoothed score must be evaluated against the dead zone boundary first, and if it falls within the dead zone, the exported movement score must be 0 — not the raw value. This ensures downstream game logic in useGameState.ts and gameState.ts never receives a non-zero score for sub-dead-zone motion.",

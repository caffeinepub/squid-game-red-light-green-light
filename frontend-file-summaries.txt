  "frontend/src/utils/audioEffects.ts": "Web Audio API procedural sound effects for all game events — green light chime, red light alarm, elimination screech, victory fanfare, and countdown beep, all synthesized without external audio files.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useWebcam.ts": "Custom hook to request webcam access via getUserMedia, attach the stream to a video ref, and expose stream status. Updated `videoRef` type to `RefObject<HTMLVideoElement | null>` for React 19 compatibility.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useMovementDetection.ts": "Custom hook running a requestAnimationFrame loop to compute pixel-diff movement scores with 8-frame smoothing. Updated both `videoRef` and `canvasRef` parameter types to `RefObject<T | null>` for React 19 compatibility.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useGameState.ts": "Game state machine hook managing all phases, progress tracking, elimination logic, survival timer, and procedural sound triggers — now imports `clampToDeadZone` from movementDetection and applies it to the raw movement score before passing it to `shouldAdvanceProgress` or `shouldEliminate`, ensuring no sub-dead-zone score ever reaches game state evaluation.",
  "frontend/src/components/GameCanvas.tsx": "Renders the webcam feed onto a canvas element with mirroring, integrates useWebcam and useMovementDetection hooks, and shows camera status overlays.",

  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app component orchestrating the 3D scene, webcam overlay, game state, HUD overlays, and full-screen modal screens — fixes the TypeScript overlap error by removing `'countdown'` from `showOverlay` (it was already covered by `isGameActive`) and simplifying the webcam overlay condition to just `isGameActive`.",
  "frontend/src/modules/scene.ts": "Scene configuration constants for the 3D world — track length, ground dimensions, finish line position, doll position, camera offsets, and a helper to convert progress (0-100) to a Z-coordinate.",
  "frontend/src/modules/movementDetection.ts": "Pure movement detection logic using MediaPipe landmark deltas — computes a smoothed movement score, exposes a `sensitivityToThreshold` helper, a `clampToDeadZone` function that explicitly zeroes any score at or below (threshold × 0.10) before it reaches game state logic, and `isMovementAboveThreshold` for direct threshold checks.",
  "frontend/src/modules/poseTracking.ts": "MediaPipe Pose CDN integration module with a small setTimeout after script load to ensure the global is registered, skeleton drawing utility with rounded line caps, and error handling for undefined/empty landmarks.",
  "frontend/src/modules/gameState.ts": "Pure game state machine logic — exports types, initial state, random light duration generator, and helper functions for determining when to advance progress or eliminate the player, both updated with a `<=` dead zone guard (scores at or exactly equal to threshold × 0.10 are ignored) acting as a second line of defence independent of the upstream clamp.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/usePoseTracking.ts": "React hook that initializes MediaPipe Pose, waits for the video element to reach readyState >= 4 (HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA) via event listeners and polling before starting the RAF loop, draws the mirrored video frame on every tick (not just in onResults), and returns movement score and landmarks.",
  "frontend/src/components/WebcamOverlay.tsx": "Fixed bottom-right overlay that renders the webcam feed and MediaPipe skeleton on a canvas — the video element now uses `opacity: 0` with absolute positioning instead of `display: none` so the browser actually plays the stream, with the canvas rendered on top showing the mirrored feed and skeleton.",
  "frontend/src/components/Player.tsx": "React Three Fiber player component rendering a capsule character (cylinder body + sphere head + legs) that smoothly interpolates its Z position based on progress, with phase-aware color (green/red/gold) and a point light.",

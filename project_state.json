  "summary": "Squid Game: Red Light, Green Light browser game — fully refactored into a 3D experience. Three.js (React Three Fiber) renders a full-screen 3D world with ground plane, finish line, and a doll at the far end. A 3D player capsule moves along a straight track with a third-person camera. @mediapipe/pose (npm, client-side) handles body tracking with a webcam overlay in the bottom-right corner and real-time skeleton drawn on top. Movement detection uses smoothed landmark deltas across core body points (shoulders, hips). Game logic preserved: Green Light advances player only when movement detected, Red Light causes immediate elimination on movement, randomized timing, survival timer, 3-2-1 countdown, procedural Web Audio API sounds, adjustable sensitivity slider, win state when player reaches finish line. Code is modular: scene.ts, poseTracking.ts, movementDetection.ts, gameState.ts.",

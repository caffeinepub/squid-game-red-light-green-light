The diff shows asymmetric smoothing: when avgDelta === 0 (all landmarks below base threshold), the smoothed score is immediately reset to 0; when avgDelta > 0, the existing exponential formula (prev×0.8 + current×0.2) is applied. The dead-zone guard and downstream logic are untouched. No hallucinated features detected.",

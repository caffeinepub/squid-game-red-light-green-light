  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-19, REQ-20, REQ-21) appear to be implemented. movementDetection.ts exports clampToDeadZone that zeroes scores at or below threshold × 0.10. gameState.ts adds dead zone guards in both shouldEliminate and shouldAdvanceProgress. useGameState.ts imports clampToDeadZone and applies it before passing scores to game state functions. The implementation is consistent with the specified acceptance criteria.",

      "reason": "REQ-20 only specified adding the dead zone guard to the elimination-check logic in gameState.ts. The diff also adds a dead zone guard inside shouldAdvanceProgress, which was not requested by any requirement.",
